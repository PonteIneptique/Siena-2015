#Linux install
From scikit-learn.org :
>  At this time scikit-learn does not provide official binary packages for Linux so you have to build from source.
>  Installing build dependencies

>  Installing from source requires you to have installed the scikit-learn runtime dependencies, Python development headers and a working C/C++ compiler. Under Debian-based operating systems, which include Ubuntu, if you have Python 2 you can install all these requirements by issuing:

>  If you have Python 3:
`sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-numpy python3-scipy libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-base`

Don't forget to also install :
`sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib`
